    Public IPv4 addresses or CIDR ranges (max /30) allowed through the storage firewall.
    When this list is non-empty, default_action becomes Deny — every other IP is blocked.

    How to add a new IP:
      1. Confirm the IP with the requestor (run `curl ifconfig.me` from their machine).
      2. Add the entry here and update dev/test/prod.tfvars accordingly.
      3. Raise a PR so it gets reviewed — storage firewall changes are audited.

    Azure does NOT accept:
      - /31 or /32 CIDRs — use bare IPs (e.g. "170.55.159.52", not "170.55.159.52/32")
      - IPv6 addresses
      - Private RFC-1918 ranges (use virtual_network_subnet_ids for VNet access instead)
